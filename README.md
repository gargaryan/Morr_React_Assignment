# How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
As Mentioned in the Desciption of the Assignment that we have  make Three Pages :
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Series</li>
<li>Movies</li>
</ul>
 => So, i follow  the instruction of the document and Decided to follow the below steps:
<ul>
<li>Initially i decide  to make the component  of these three above mentioned.</li>
<li>Making the content of each page as component like Header comoonent, Footer Component, Content Component etc.</li>
<li>Then,Linking of each Page( by  React-Routing ) </li>
<li>Fetch the Json file in Series and Movies component.</li>
<li> Display the item According to the condition given in the Assignment.For Sorting the element I import underscore(_) library of React.</li>
<li> Implementing the Error Status Mechanism while fetching the data from Json File.</li>
<li>Finally, upload the Assignment on the Github. Files do not contain node modules so for this you  should  install React in the System when starting the Project. </li>
</ul> 

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
<ul>
<li>I glad that I done the Assignment  as per the company fullfillment .There might be many improvements but I noticed that I could make the Ui more better and add more functionality to it like i could make login Page And signup Page. </li>

<li>I would  make the Express Server And Driven  the entire Project through it.</li>
<li>I  would Make the Login and Signup Page for the Better intreaction with the Website.</li>
<li> I Would connect the project to the MongoDb and store the Login and signup page credentials to it.</li>
