As Mentioned in the Desciption of the Assignment that we have  make Three Pages :
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Series</li>
<li>Movies</li>
</ul>
 => So,  I go through the document you have sent and worked accordingly.the procedure of my given assignement as listed below:
<ul>
<li>Initially i decide  to make the components of  above listed pages.</li>
<li>Making the content of each page as component like Header, Footer, Content etc.</li>
<li>Then,I Linked all pages through Routing.</li>
<li>Fetch the Json file in Series and Movies component.</li>
<li> Display the item accordingly.For Sorting the elements I import underscore(_) library of React.</li>
<li> Implementing the Error Status Mechanism while fetching the data from Json File.</li>
<li>Finally, upload the Assignment on the Github. Files do not contain node modules so for this you must install React in the System while running the Project. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I glad that I have done the Assignment as per the company requirements.There might be many improvements but I noticed that I could make the Ui more better and add more functionality to it like i could make login Page And signup Page. </li>
